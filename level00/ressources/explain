I was analising the first level and not finding anything on
the terminal config files that was there on the ~/ home folder.

So I started checking what users where created to maybe find
anything created by them that could be interesting

With the command "cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd", I was able to see the
whole list of users in the machine.

Using the command find with options -user I started 
tracking every files that every users owned (man find for -user option).

Everything were only directories, procs, binaries or just no permission.
Except for the flag00 user where I found two files

/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

They outputed the same things : "cdiiddwpgswtgt"

I tried the su flag00 with the password but it wasn't the answer !

I suspected it to be a crypted string so using this website
(https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) I was able to know that is
is a rot cipher (also known as Cesar Cipher)
So basically it's just a rotation of the alphabet.
In this case 11 times and 15 times when it's backward (total 26).
For exemple 'a' become 'p', 'b' become 'q', etc...

See rotate_cipher.c:
decrypted: "notxxxxxxxhere"

Then su flag00 using the flag.
