Like in the level00, I started to search in the users
with the find -user command and looking at the /etc/passwd file.

I noticed that only the flag01 password is shown (not an 'x' like other users)
The password in the /etc/passwd file are only hashes so
impossible to use them unless if we decrypt it.

(https://askubuntu.com/questions/383057/how-to-decode-the-hash-password-in-etc-shadow)

After some research (link above) I found "john" to be the best option to decrypt hashes.
But it is impossible to use it on the VM (no rights).

Installed john on macos here:
https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/john/contrib/macosx/

I copied the /etc/passwd file in my repo and ran john in it.

john ~/Desktop/snow-crash/level01/ressources/copy_passwd

Gave me this output:

```
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (descrypt, traditional crypt(3) [DES 256/256 AVX2-16])
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably

```

So the password for flag01 user is "abcdefg".
